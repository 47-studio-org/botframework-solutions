# Bot Framework Solutions

This repository is the home for a set of templates, solutions and skills to help build advanced conversational experiences.

Creation of a high quality conversational experience requires a foundational set of capabilities. To help you succeed with building more complex, assistant-like  conversational experiences, we have created an Virtual Assistant Template. This template brings together all of the best practices and supporting components we've identified through building of conversational experiences. 

This repo is a part of [Bot Framework](https://botframework.com, which includes [Azure Bot Service](https://aka.ms/azurebotservice), [LUIS](https://luis.ai), [QnAMaker](https://qnamaker.ai), Emulator and Bot Builder SDK.
